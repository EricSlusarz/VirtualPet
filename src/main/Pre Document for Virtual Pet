This is my Yak Shaving mark down document describing what this project will involve.

Don't froget to add the test folder and JUnit library as a dependency(whatever that means).
Add a scanner
We will be making a virtual pet. This project needs to have a:
	-three attributes
	-three messages(or methods)
	-one method needs to be a tick method
		+ a tick method seems indicate a lapse of time or a "turn" has taken place
	-also we need a main method (or an ApplicationMethod; i will just call it main0

Let's start with three features and make that work first.
 So just: Hunger Thirst and Sleepiness and then hopefully more but watch out for scope creep.
 Don't know how time works or how to build it in java so tick will be called when we enter a number in
 We could use random to activate a some methods or make one random method with conditions in it.
 Make sure tick is used as kind of a gear that makes things turn and update. I think tick can be used as interpolation (whatever that means).
 Make sure feeding brings down hunger and the same with the other attributes
 Go with a theme like fighting crime.
 
 I would like to make a fun game where there is some sort of goal so hopefully I can implement that.
 Get some ascii art or better yet bring in some graphical libraries that can make some sort of animal.
 
  maybe write a test.
 
 
 Post hoc: I did it but it is really messy. I like that game but I wished that my thread worked.
